# Windsurf Editor: Tips & Best Practices 🚀

Windsurf is an AI-powered code editor (based on VS Code) that offers advanced coding assistance features. It understands your whole project context and can write, refactor, debug, and even run code for you. Compared to similar tools (like Cursor AI), Windsurf offers **better pricing 💰, richer features 🛠️, faster performance ⚡, deeper contextual understanding 🧠, and automated bug fixing 🐛🔧**. If you’re already using Windsurf, the tips below will help you use it more effectively and save credits 🧾.

## 🔥 Key Benefits

* **Cost & Performance 💸⚡:** Windsurf’s pricing is competitive and its performance is optimized for large projects. You get fast autocomplete and AI assistance without excessive overhead.
* **Context Awareness 🧠:** Windsurf builds a *global index* of your entire codebase (not just open files), so autocomplete suggestions and AI responses are highly informed by all your code.
* **Agentic Coding (Cascade) 🤖:** The Cascade AI Flows let the AI propose, run, and iteratively refine code, making coding feel like a conversation. You approve or adjust each step, ensuring control.
* **Smart Completion ✨:** The **Supercomplete** feature predicts your intent, not just the next token. It can generate complete functions (with docs) that fit your code’s context.
* **Inline Edits ✍️:** Windsurf’s **Inline AI (Command)** mode (activated with <kbd>Ctrl+I</kbd>) lets you edit or expand specific code blocks without touching the rest of the file. It’s great for refactoring or adding comments to highlighted code.
* **Persistence (Memories & Rules) 📚:** You can create **Memories** and **Rules** to store project-specific knowledge or coding guidelines. These persist across sessions so the AI remembers your preferences.
* **Integrated Terminal (AI Terminal) 💻🧑‍💻:** Windsurf extends AI assistance into the terminal. You can prompt the AI to generate shell commands or troubleshoot errors directly in your CLI.

## 🧩 Core Features

* **Supercomplete ⚙️:** Goes beyond usual autocomplete by predicting your next action. For example, it can generate an entire Python function (with a docstring) based on your code and past prompts.
* **Inline AI (Command) 🎯:** Highlight code or place the cursor, press <kbd>Ctrl+I</kbd>, and ask Windsurf to modify that block or insert new code there. This is ideal for precise edits like refactoring, commenting, or generating docstrings.
* **Cascade (AI Flows) 🌀:** Cascade is an interactive coding flow. Windsurf will generate or change code, ask for your confirmation before executing anything, then follow up with additional questions to refine results.
* **Local Index 🗂️:** The built-in indexing engine scans your entire project so the AI can “see” all your code at once. This makes suggestions more accurate and relevant, especially in large codebases.
* **Memories & Rules 🧠📖:** Windsurf stores context across chats. You can write *rules* (in `.windsurf/rules/` or a global `rules.md`) to teach the AI things like “always use Python 3 style” or “our UI framework is Vue.js.” These do not consume extra credits.
* **AI Terminal 🧑‍💻:** In the integrated terminal, hit <kbd>Ctrl+I</kbd> and type a natural-language instruction. Windsurf will output the corresponding CLI command.

## 💡 Using Windsurf in the Terminal

Windsurf extends its AI power to the terminal. Press <kbd>Ctrl+I</kbd> while in the terminal and describe the command you want; the AI will suggest the proper syntax. For example, you can rename a Git branch by typing “rename current branch from *feature* to *main*”. Windsurf would generate commands like:

```bash
git branch -m feature main
git push origin main
git push origin --delete feature
```

This saves you from recalling exact Git flags 🎯. You can then review and run the commands. (Windsurf can also execute commands for you if you enable “Auto mode” ⚙️, with the allow/deny lists described below.)

---

## ✅ Allow & ❌ Deny Lists

Windsurf lets you customize which terminal commands run automatically.

* **✅ Allow List:** A set of commands that Windsurf will always execute without asking. For example, adding `git` to the allow list means commands like `git add -A` or `git branch -m main` will auto-run as soon as the AI suggests them.

* **❌ Deny List:** Any command on this list will always prompt you for permission. For instance, if you add `rm` to the deny list, Windsurf will never delete files (`rm file.txt`) without your explicit approval.

You can configure these via Settings (`windsurf.cascadeCommandsAllowList` / `cascadeCommandsDenyList`). This helps you streamline safe actions while guarding dangerous ones 🛡️.

## 🧠 Memories & 📏 Rules

Windsurf’s Cascade AI uses a **memory system** to retain information across chats. There are two kinds of memories:

* **User-defined rules 📝:** Explicit instructions saved in `.windsurf/rules/` or global rule files. Example: “Use Vue instead of React” or “Always snake\_case in Python.”
* **Auto-generated memories 🤖:** Windsurf learns from your interactions, storing valuable patterns, styles, or preferences automatically.

Memories are project-scoped and **free to use**—they don’t cost any tokens. Use them to avoid repeating yourself and enforce consistency 🔁.

## ✅ Tips & Best Practices

* **Use Tab Autocomplete ⌨️:** Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> for inline completions. It’s fast, free, and context-rich thanks to the Local Index.

* **Inline Edits with `<kbd>Ctrl+I</kbd>` ✨:** Use for quick, precise changes (e.g., “Add logging here” or “Refactor this to use a ternary”). These don’t consume credits!

  ```python
  def slow_sum(numbers):
      total = 0
      for n in numbers:
          total += n
      return total
  ```

  Prompt: “Refactor to one-liner”

  Suggested:

  ```python
  def slow_sum(numbers):
      return sum(numbers)
  ```

* **Use Cascade for Complex Tasks 🧩:** For multi-step flows (e.g., generate backend API + test cases), Cascade is ideal. Don’t use it for simple formatting—Inline or Tab is better for that.

* **Give Context Upfront 📄:** Upload docs, paste API samples, or write a quick memory. This avoids repeated clarification.

* **Enable Auto-Linter 🧼:** It fixes minor issues automatically and for free.

* **Choose the Right Model 🧠💰:** For smaller tasks, use Gemini Flash or DeepSeek to save tokens. Reserve Claude/Gemini Ultra for long-context or reasoning-heavy tasks.

* **Write Memories for Repeating Patterns 🔁:** If the AI keeps forgetting something, save it as a rule or memory. Saves credits and frustration.

* **Let It Handle Git 📦:** You can ask it to commit/push code, and it’ll handle both message and command generation for you.
